	* GConf.pm: updated documentation.
	
2004/01/29 13:27 (+0100) ebassi

	* xs/GConfClient.xs: implemented
		gconf_client_error
		gconf_client_unreturned_error
		gconf_client_value_changed
	  these methods emit their relative signal, and should not be used,
	  but could be needed for testing. I've translated the GError
	  parameter of the C functions with an hashref containing the error id
	  and message.

2004/01/27 04:14 (+0100) ebassi

	* GConf.pm, META.yml: version 0.46

2004/01/27 04:01 (+0100) ebassi
	
	* GConf.pm: bound set_/get_list and set_/get_pair; I've implemented
	  them in Perl, since writing them in XS would have been overkill.

2004/01/24 21:44 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: removed runtime_reqs stuff, replaced by the pkg-config 
	trick
	
	* perl-Gnome2-GConf.spec.in: use pkg-config for Requires version

2004/01/08 22:00 (+0100) ebassi

	* GConf.pm: version 0.45

2004/01/08 21:55 (+0100) ebassi
	
	* xs/GConfClient.xs: better apidoc for change_set methods.
	
	* xs/GConfSchema.xs, xs/GConfEntry.xs: added function name to the
	  croak() calls.

2003/12/31 02:19 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GConf2.xs: mark ax unused in functions which don't touch the
	input stack, to hush compiler warnings

2003/12/29 16:32 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* perl-Gnome2-GConf.spec.in: use the new DATE replacement in conjunction
	with VERSION to create the changlog on the fly, which is better.

2003/12/22 23:51 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GConfClient.xs: remove the type specifiers on the class
	parameters, to keep xsubpp from creating a value that will be
	unused and therefore cause unused variable warnings.

2003/11/29 17:46 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* xs/GConfClient.xs: dGPERL_CLOSURE_MARSHAL_ARGS has to be the last dec
	b/c it doesn't always seem to be only decs.

2003/11/29 09:15 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GConfEntry.xs, xs/GConfSchema.xs: remove unused variables to
	hush compiler warnings.

	  libgconf version symbols (thanks to Torsten Schoenfeld).
	* GConf.pm: added documentation for the gconf_client_commit_change_set
	  method.

2003/11/25 17:22 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* GConf.pm: removed use Gnome2 which falsly made Gnome2 a dep, 
	kaffee found it.

2003/11/24 22:55 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: fixes to rpm gen stuff

	* perl-Gnome2-GConf.spec.in: intial import

	* MANIFEST: updates

2003/11/21 12:27 (+0100) ebassi

	* Makefile.PL, README: change minimum required versions for Glib and
	  Gtk modules (1.012), since it's release time.

2003/11/18 23:20 (+0100) ebassi

	* README: changed version and minimum required version of Glib and
	  Gtk modules.
	
	* Makefile.PL: new required versions for Glib and Gtk modules (1.011).

2003/11/18 18:37 (+0100) ebassi
	
	* GConf.pm: bumped to version 0.42.

	* examples/comples-gconf-app.pl: better code and comments.
	
	* GConf.pm: added "ERROR HANDLING" section inside the documentation.

	* Makefile.PL: new required versions for Glib and Gtk modules (1.02);
	  needed for the marshalling helper macros.
	
	* xs/GConfClient.xs: make use of the new marshalling helper macros
	  inside the custom marshallers for "error" and "unreturned_error"
	  signals (muppet).
	
	* xs/*.xs: less criptic croak messages.
	
	* xs/*.xs: remove header dependency on gnome2perl.h - gconfperl.h is
 	  enough (muppet).
	
	* gconfperl.h: removed header dependency on gnome2perl.h - using
	  gperl.h instead (muppet).

2003/11/18 00:07 (+0100) ebassi

	* examples/complex-gconf-app.pl: added this example application that
	  uses GConfChangeSets and GConfSchemas.

2003/11/17 21:12 (+0100) ebassi
	
	* debian/*, MANIFEST: removed debian packaging info before committing
	  the package.
	
	* *: committed to CVS.

2003/11/17 20:53 (+0100) ebassi
		
	* xs/GConfChangeSet.xs: implemented GConfChangeSet as an hashref
	  with GConf keys as hash keys and hashrefs in place of GConfValues;
	  see documentation for more details.

	* xs/GConfClient.xs: implemented
		gconf_client_commit_change_set

2003/10/17 13:25 (+0200) ebassi

	* xs/GConfClient.xs: created custom marshaller for "error" and
	  "unreturned_error" signals; these signal pass a GError in C, and
	  since in gtk2-perl that's not a GType, we swap it inside the Perl
	  marshaller with the string which contains the error message.

2003/10/12 13:26 (+0200) ebassi

	* xs/GConfSchema.xs: implemented GConfSchema container as GConfEntry
	  and GConfValue - using an hashref.

	* xs/GConfClient.xs: implemented
		gconf_client_get_schema
		gconf_client_set_schema
	* debian/*: debianized package.
	
	* examples/basic-gconf-app.pl: placed some comments.

2003/09/21 23:45 (+0200) ebassi

	* xs/GConfClient.xs: implemented gconf_client_all_entries (patch by
	  Luis Lopez Lopez).

2003/09/19 12:44 (+0200) ebassi

	* xs/GConfEntry.xs: added the reverse converter for GConfEntry (it
	  creates a GConfEntry from an hashref).
	
	* xs/GConfClient.xs: implemented
		gconf_client_all_dirs
		gconf_client_get_entry
		gconf_client_get_without_default
		gconf_client_get_default_from_schema

2003/09/19 12:17 (+0200) ebassi
	
	* examples/basic-gconf-app,pl: connected the 'focus_out_event' signal.
	
	* Makefile.PL: changed minimum required version for GConf to 1.2.0, in
	  order to cover GNOME 2.0 (thanks to muppet); fixed a cut&paste typo.
	
	* xs/GConfValue.xs: croak if an invalid hashref is passed to
	  SvGConfValue, instead of silently discarding it.
	
2003/09/19 01:56 (+0200) ebassi
